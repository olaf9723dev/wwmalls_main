You can read the full list of benefits for store owners and get started at [GetBizPrint.com](https://getbizprint.com/)

BizPrint prints your WooCommerce orders automatically to your existing printer, and has the reliability, flexibility, and customizability you need for your specific use case. You’ve found the right plugin!

= Why Create Printed Receipts For Your Store? =
Any transaction between a store and customer needs some evidence of purchase. There are many reasons to make your WooCommerce order details physical. For example:

*   If you run a restaurant, the kitchen and wait staff will need physical copies of the order so they can prepare the food and serve customers with maximum efficiency.
*   For warehouses or fulfillment centers, a printed order will help pickers and packers to prepare and fulfill an order without delay.
*   In lots of cases, a customer will want a printed receipt in order to prove a purchase, for product returns, employer reimbursement or for tax purposes.

BizPrint has a customer satisfaction rating of 4.8 stars and boasts 99.5% reliability uptime on our globally distributed servers that power the cloud. We have answered over 7,500 support tickets last year alone and can’t wait to help save you time!

But don’t just take our word for it! This is what Chris from Kyoto Sushi had to say about how BizPrint is helping their business:
> “We started taking orders online and printing them with BizPrint, and it has been game changing. BizPrint improves the customer experience, reduces kitchen downtime, and frees up my time. My staff are 30% more productive. I can outperform our competitors (including on UberEat, Deliveroo, etc) whilst having lower costs, better quality, and lower prices. If you own a restaurant, getting BizPrint is a no-brainer.” - Chris L. Owner Kyoto Sushi Restaurant.

> If you need to use WooCommerce in-person, want to save money by emailing your receipts, or just need great looking receipts (I receive compliments about our receipts), I’d highly recommend BizPrint.

== BizPrint WooCommerce Mapping:  ==
*   Product & Category Mapping: Using the [Product & Category Mapping feature](https://getbizprint.com/features/mapping/) you can setup specific printers to only display printed items from chosen WooCommerce products & categories. Setup multiple printer stations, and create efficient workflows to optimize fulfillment within your business.
*   Shipping Zones & Methods Mapping: Using the [Shipping Zones & Methods Mapping](http://getbizprint.com/features/mapping/#shipping) you can setup printers to only print orders from defined shipping zones and methods. This can really help businesses that have multiple locations, fulfillment stations or other creative uses, like food trucks!

Our users really enjoy this feature. This is what the owner of Mighty Moose Marts, a retail & online store had to say about printer stations:
> “One of the strengths to us was the ability to support multiple printers in different locations.
> 
> We’re using BizPrint to automatically print customer receipts at our ordering station and simultaneously print in the kitchen to fulfill the order. The impact is improved kitchen times, increased sales, and happier customers. I’d highly recommend BizPrint to other small businesses for in-store Point of Sale orders or orders placed online by your customers.” - Chris R. Co-Owner, Mighty Moose Marts.
