","My business offers a unique, valuable and much needed service to Nanaimo. The size of the bus (easier to get in and out of than a van, more friendly than a large highway bus) is comfortable for the seniors. We will get to beauty spots and historic and cultural sites, visit art and craft studios while supporting artists and merchants, restaurants, growers and coastal sightseeing operators. Trips are not merely a bus ride from A to B but include side trips to hidden gems around local communities, which vary with the weather and the whim of the group. All this while sharing experiences and conversations with new friends, keeping the participants interested and active, thus contributing to quality of life and good health, avoiding the incidence of isolation, anxiety and illness/depression which are a risk for retirees.

DO YOU HAVE FAMILY COMING AND YOU HAVE TO WORK. WHY NOT SEND THEM OUT FOR SOME FUN ON MY BUS. SIGN THEM UP ON A DAY TRIP.
MEMBERSHIP NOT NEEDED.

","My business offers a unique, valuable and much needed service to Nanaimo. The size of the bus (easier to get in and out of than a van, more friendly than a large highway bus) is comfortable for the seniors. We will get to beauty spots and historic and cultural sites, visit art and craft studios while supporting artists and merchants, restaurants, growers and coastal sightseeing operators. Trips are not merely a bus ride from A to B but include side trips to hidden gems around local communities, which vary with the weather and the whim of the group. All this while sharing experiences and conversations with new friends, keeping the participants interested and active, thus contributing to quality of life and good health, avoiding the incidence of isolation, anxiety and illness/depression which are a risk for retirees.

DO YOU HAVE FAMILY COMING AND YOU HAVE TO WORK. WHY NOT SEND THEM OUT FOR SOME FUN ON MY BUS. SIGN THEM UP ON A DAY TRIP.
MEMBERSHIP NOT NEEDED.

","Rob Janssen has always had an interest in all things mechanical - from his very first hot rod cars and motorcycles, to heavy duty equipment, farm machinery, and everything in between. In 1994 Rob Janssen established R.E.Cycle in Chemainus on Vancouver Island. It's not like most motorcycle shops out there nowadays. R.E.Cycle is ""old school"". It doesn't have a million dollar showroom, but more often than not it's got the parts to save your ride, and mechanics who can get it fixed when you can't. R.E.Cycle will repair almost anything. The shop was initially geared to repair and supply new and used parts for American motorcycles; Buell and Harley Davidson, and we remain focused on Harley Davidson in particular, but within a short time the demand to repair all makes and models of motorbikes was evident.

So R.E.Cycle started repairing and supplying both new and used parts and accessories for virtually all brands and types of motorcycles including: scooters, street bikes, dirt bikes, Chinese bikes, ATV’s, and even snowmobiles. R.E.Cycle has grown over its 25 years from the little shop that could, into one of the most successful bike shops on Vancouver Island.

Commercial & Industrial,","My interest in working with stones, has evolved slowly from early childhood. Growing up and playing amongst old stone structures in Brittany France, the seed was planted. This eventually led me to pursuing stone masonry as more than a career. In B.C. It grew to become a passion. I picked up every opportunity to work along side European trained stone masons in order to acquire the necessary skills and attention to details. Over the years, raising a family did draw me away from my goal. But as soon as our three boys turned into young men, I took the plunge and started ""Zav's Stone work"" now Zavs-Stonework. With my three sons as helpers and apprentice we were able to take on sizable contracts.

","Permanent makeup (also known as cosmetic tattooing) can be very beneficial. Imagine never having to worry about drawing on your eyebrows anymore, if your eyeliner has smudged, or if your lipstick has faded. Permanent makeup can leave you feeling beautiful, whether at the end of a long day or in the early morning, right when you wake up. Raelene of Face FX apprenticed under Sandra Danchuk at Sandra's Ink in Nanaimo BC starting in 2009, and continues to work in Nanaimo. Raelene is innovative, and has a keen artistic eye for cosmetic tattooing. She is also a stickler for perfection, and will make sure you are happy and feeling confident about yourself! In the initial appointment, you will discuss design and colour of your permanent makeup. There are also two follow-up appointments to ensure you are thrilled with your new tattoo. If you are looking for permanent eyebrows, eyeliner, lips, or lip liner, Face FX is the place to go.

","Rob Janssen has always had an interest in all things mechanical - from his very first hot rod cars and motorcycles, to heavy duty equipment, farm machinery, and everything in between. In 1994 Rob Janssen established R.E.Cycle in Chemainus on Vancouver Island. It's not like most motorcycle shops out there nowadays. R.E.Cycle is ""old school"". It doesn't have a million dollar showroom, but more often than not it's got the parts to save your ride, and mechanics who can get it fixed when you can't. R.E.Cycle will repair almost anything. The shop was initially geared to repair and supply new and used parts for American motorcycles; Buell and Harley Davidson, and we remain focused on Harley Davidson in particular, but within a short time the demand to repair all makes and models of motorbikes was evident.

So R.E.Cycle started repairing and supplying both new and used parts and accessories for virtually all brands and types of motorcycles including: scooters, street bikes, dirt bikes, Chinese bikes, ATV’s, and even snowmobiles. R.E.Cycle has grown over its 25 years from the little shop that could, into one of the most successful bike shops on Vancouver Island.

He attended the Virginia Military Institute for one year and went on to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point on June 11, 1909. He was then commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the 15th cavalry Regiment.Patton married Beatrice Ayer, whom he dated while at West Point, on May 26, 1910.

","We have been serving satisfied heat pump customers in Victoria for over 20 years, and will be here to look after you for many years to come. We are the only premier dealer for Lennox in Victoria, BC. A heat pump is an all-in-one cooling and heating system. During summer months, it works like an air conditioner. It extracts heat from inside your home and transfers it to the outdoor air. When the weather's cooler, it does the exact opposite, taking heat from outside and moving it inside. For optimal comfort and efficiency, a Lennox heat pump can be combined with a gas furnace in one dual-fuel system.

The mandate of the BC Aboriginal Network on Disability Society is: To Promote the Betterment of Aboriginal People with Disabilities. The organization was founded in July 1991, to deal specifically with the issues of Aboriginal People with special needs. Quote from the Honourable Ethel Blondin-Andrew, Minister of Secretary of State, Children and Youth (in an address to the BCANDS General Assembly Oct. 1995): There are few situations more challenging or more pressing than the plight of Aboriginal people living with disabilities. According to Stats Canada, about 15% of the general population are people with disabilities. We have to double that figure to get a measure of how much more serious the issues are in Aboriginal communities. Thirty-one percent of our community members live with a disability - almost a third of our population are leading lives of quiet desperation. This reality influences the life of the entire community. In Canada, we are a democracy and we are judged not only how we treat everyone but on how we treat the people who need the help the most. The weakest, and the people that are most marginalized.

",250-652-7499,www.infraredhealth.com,,,"Sun Stream Saunas is a division of Nature's Spectrum Health Inc. Nature's Spectrum is one of Canada's original Infrared sauna companies established in 1999 and incorporated in 2001. We opened the first Infrared Sauna user facility in Victoria BC where hundreds of clients have visited to experience the benefits of Infrared saunas. We have seen a lot of sweat here! Nature's Spectrum developed an objective testing procedure to gauge sauna heaters' IR output in our quest to acquire the highest performing Infrared heaters. Our testing procedure has been contracted by other IR sauna companies to validate their heaters' Infrared. In the past 11 years, our company has collaborated with top manufacturers in the industry in North America, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. We have always sought out Infrared sauna products that ensure a satisfying sauna experience, use high quality materials and boast superior craftsmanship. In November 2008, we partnered with Golden Wave Saunas of Taiwan to create the new Sun Stream Sauna. Golden Wave is an established company that has produced IR saunas and IR therapy products for 10 years. They are one of very few sauna companies who develop and produce their own Infrared heaters, the internationally patented Nano-Carbon heaters. We are an authentic sauna company that strives to ensure that you enjoy a satisfying experience with your new sauna. We provide deliveries and installations in BC and ship our saunas across Canada regularly. We stock spare parts for the products we sell and have the expertise to provide proper after sales service. Sun Stream Saunas are backed with an Unconditional Lifetime Manufacturer's Warranty on our Nano-Carbon heaters and Five Years on our Electronic Control Systems. Please Note: Most low cost saunas sold through Big Box retailers have only One Year Warranties from remote secondary distributors. With years of experience working with and using Infrared saunas, we believe our Sun Stream to be the best performing, best constructed and best sauna for your money available.

His practice is focused on representing people who have been injured due to the negligence of others. He handles motor vehicle accidents, occupier’s liability (a.k.a. slip-and-fall), and medical malpractice cases. Mitchell has helped people with a vast array of injuries, including complex brain, orthopedic, psychiatric, vestibular, and chronic pain disorders / soft tissue injuries. He currently sits on the executive council of the Victoria Bar Association and is a member of the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia and the Canadian Bar Association.

“I think it is important to recognize that each person’s individual characteristics can result in one person being affected very differently by an accident than another person, even though they may have suffered similar injuries. I like to get to know my clients so that I can better understand how their injuries have affected them and use that information to achieve a result that is fair in their individual circumstances.”

","The words Love Is Round arrived in Sherry Morgan's prayer time in October, 2015. A flood of inspiration followed, including an understanding of what those words point to and why they are so important and relevant at this time. Love is Round points to a core design of our universe, which we are integrally a part of, and explains the experience people have when connecting with aspects of the natural world. Teaching people about the Phenomenon of Prayer, the core basis of which is the experience of connection with aspects of the natural world, has been Sherry’s work since 1998. Love is Round became the context for her work and the name for her website.

","Rubbish psychology 101. Over time, Mark's hauling and Recycling has learned a thing or two about rubbish. The most striking fact we uncovered was that we love our junk! We accumulate it we hang on to it, we have emotions and memories attached to it. Each item has a story to tell, it's hard to let go. But when the house is full and can't park the car in the garage anymore, the inevitable happens we snap! We want to see it all gone right now. But don't feel guilty. The renewal process has just begun. Mark's hauling and recycling will find a new purpose for all those treasures, and that's no trash.

We have assisted many offices over the past 15 years, and can help you decide what type, size, and speed of printer would best suit your office. We will not only help your office function correctly, but also provide you with appropriate options to suit your needs as well as your price range.

You will never be sold a printer by us that you do not require. Additionally, we will discourage you from spending your hard earned money on a unit that cannot handle the volume of usage, based on your office size, and that will need to be replaced or repaired over and over due to high print volume or excessive use.

If you're thinking of purchasing a new printer and would like some advice, give us a call. We will visit your office, assess your needs and make our recommendations complimentary when you purchase your printer from V.I. Printers.

It means that I deal with any type of claim involving a person suffering injuries through the fault of another. However, I do not deal with Workers' Compensation claims. The most common type of claim is for injuries suffered in a car accident. If the accident occurred in BC then it is likely you are dealing with the ICBC. I have a great deal of experience in dealing with these claims. I also deal with claims for long term disability (LTD) benefits and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits. My clients are located all over British Columbia and elsewhere. My general philosophy is focused upon recovery. What I mean by this is that I do whatever I can to assist clients in recovering from their injuries.

","What do I do? Essentially, I help people. I practice personal injury law. What does that mean? It means that I deal with any type of claim involving a person suffering injuries through the fault of another. However, I do not deal with Workers' Compensation claims. The most common type of claim is for injuries suffered in a car accident. If the accident occurred in BC then it is likely you are dealing with the ICBC. I have a great deal of experience in dealing with these claims. I also deal with claims for long term disability (LTD) benefits and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits. My clients are located all over British Columbia and elsewhere. My general philosophy is focused upon recovery. What I mean by this is that I do whatever I can to assist clients in recovering from their injuries.

","Welcome to R&R Projectz! We specialize in cabinet refacing. What is cabinet refacing? Cabinet refacing consists of removing the old doors and drawers, replacing them with new colour coordinated doors, ranging from wood to thermofoil (PVC). We then use matching materials for the outer surfaces to match your new door choice. (This includes panels, toe-kick, and edge taping).Is refacing right for me?    Do you like your current kitchen layout?    Do your existing kitchen cabinets have that ""worn out"" or ""outdated"" appearance,     but are solidly constructed?    Do you want a fresh look for your kitchen without the cost of a whole new kitchen?     Or the time constraint of a full renovation?    Do you want to add drawers, roll-outs, lazy susans and cabinet modifications     without changing your entire kitchen?If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then kitchen refacing is for you!

We have assisted many offices over the past 15 years, and can help you decide what type, size, and speed of printer would best suit your office. We will not only help your office function correctly, but also provide you with appropriate options to suit your needs as well as your price range.

You will never be sold a printer by us that you do not require. Additionally, we will discourage you from spending your hard earned money on a unit that cannot handle the volume of usage, based on your office size, and that will need to be replaced or repaired over and over due to high print volume or excessive use.

If you're thinking of purchasing a new printer and would like some advice, give us a call. We will visit your office, assess your needs and make our recommendations complimentary when you purchase your printer from V.I. Printers.

The mandate of the BC Aboriginal Network on Disability Society is: To Promote the Betterment of Aboriginal People with Disabilities. The organization was founded in July 1991, to deal specifically with the issues of Aboriginal People with special needs. Quote from the Honourable Ethel Blondin-Andrew, Minister of Secretary of State, Children and Youth (in an address to the BCANDS General Assembly Oct. 1995): There are few situations more challenging or more pressing than the plight of Aboriginal people living with disabilities. According to Stats Canada, about 15% of the general population are people with disabilities. We have to double that figure to get a measure of how much more serious the issues are in Aboriginal communities. Thirty-one percent of our community members live with a disability - almost a third of our population are leading lives of quiet desperation. This reality influences the life of the entire community. In Canada, we are a democracy and we are judged not only how we treat everyone but on how we treat the people who need the help the most. The weakest, and the people that are most marginalized.

It's not just our unique shape that defines us, but our awesome mound of profound fudge flavors.
And it's GLUTEN FREE!
Over 50 flavors in total!
We were one of a select handful of Canadians that were invited to a Pre-Emmy and Pre-Oscar Swag Bag Venues in Hollywood, California.
We aimed for the moon, but shot to the stars!!!
Once you go round, you'll never go square. It's not hip to be square anymore!

We cut the corners to save you money, that's why we are Fudge In A Round!

","My business offers a unique, valuable and much needed service to Nanaimo. The size of the bus (easier to get in and out of than a van, more friendly than a large highway bus) is comfortable for the seniors. We will get to beauty spots and historic and cultural sites, visit art and craft studios while supporting artists and merchants, restaurants, growers and coastal sightseeing operators. Trips are not merely a bus ride from A to B but include side trips to hidden gems around local communities, which vary with the weather and the whim of the group. All this while sharing experiences and conversations with new friends, keeping the participants interested and active, thus contributing to quality of life and good health, avoiding the incidence of isolation, anxiety and illness/depression which are a risk for retirees.

DO YOU HAVE FAMILY COMING AND YOU HAVE TO WORK. WHY NOT SEND THEM OUT FOR SOME FUN ON MY BUS. SIGN THEM UP ON A DAY TRIP.
MEMBERSHIP NOT NEEDED.

Haul the sails, take the helm, climb the rigging, ride the bowsprit, fire the cannon, do some whale watching, hang in the hammock, relax and enjoy. Bring a picnic. Alcohol is permitted. Gear provided. All ages and abilities welcome. Built by the Captain from recycled materials, THANE is modeled after Slocum's SPRAY, the first vessel to circumnavigate single-handed in 1895.
