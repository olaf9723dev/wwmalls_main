","My business offers a unique, valuable and much needed service to Nanaimo. The size of the bus (easier to get in and out of than a van, more friendly than a large highway bus) is comfortable for the seniors. We will get to beauty spots and historic and cultural sites, visit art and craft studios while supporting artists and merchants, restaurants, growers and coastal sightseeing operators. Trips are not merely a bus ride from A to B but include side trips to hidden gems around local communities, which vary with the weather and the whim of the group. All this while sharing experiences and conversations with new friends, keeping the participants interested and active, thus contributing to quality of life and good health, avoiding the incidence of isolation, anxiety and illness/depression which are a risk for retirees.

DO YOU HAVE FAMILY COMING AND YOU HAVE TO WORK. WHY NOT SEND THEM OUT FOR SOME FUN ON MY BUS. SIGN THEM UP ON A DAY TRIP.
MEMBERSHIP NOT NEEDED.

","Permanent makeup (also known as cosmetic tattooing) can be very beneficial. Imagine never having to worry about drawing on your eyebrows anymore, if your eyeliner has smudged, or if your lipstick has faded. Permanent makeup can leave you feeling beautiful, whether at the end of a long day or in the early morning, right when you wake up. Raelene of Face FX apprenticed under Sandra Danchuk at Sandra's Ink in Nanaimo BC starting in 2009, and continues to work in Nanaimo. Raelene is innovative, and has a keen artistic eye for cosmetic tattooing. She is also a stickler for perfection, and will make sure you are happy and feeling confident about yourself! In the initial appointment, you will discuss design and colour of your permanent makeup. There are also two follow-up appointments to ensure you are thrilled with your new tattoo. If you are looking for permanent eyebrows, eyeliner, lips, or lip liner, Face FX is the place to go.

","Dog n' Suds is owned and operated by Daria Holmboe, who started the company on Bowen Rd. Needing the room to grow and add Doggie Daycare she Purchased the location at 2209 Wilgress Rd. People often ask me why I decided to work with dogs. My answer quite simply is that I love them! I have always been entertained and fascinated by them so offering a place where dogs can enjoy themselves in a safe environment was the perfect way for me to spend my days with them. After our expansion from grooming and u-wash to doggy daycare and teeth cleaning, I'm proud that we are able to offer all the services that you need for your dog. Dog n' Suds is a proud supporter of the Nanaimo SPCA.

","We have been serving satisfied heat pump customers in Victoria for over 20 years, and will be here to look after you for many years to come. We are the only premier dealer for Lennox in Victoria, BC. A heat pump is an all-in-one cooling and heating system. During summer months, it works like an air conditioner. It extracts heat from inside your home and transfers it to the outdoor air. When the weather's cooler, it does the exact opposite, taking heat from outside and moving it inside. For optimal comfort and efficiency, a Lennox heat pump can be combined with a gas furnace in one dual-fuel system.

The mandate of the BC Aboriginal Network on Disability Society is: To Promote the Betterment of Aboriginal People with Disabilities. The organization was founded in July 1991, to deal specifically with the issues of Aboriginal People with special needs. Quote from the Honourable Ethel Blondin-Andrew, Minister of Secretary of State, Children and Youth (in an address to the BCANDS General Assembly Oct. 1995): There are few situations more challenging or more pressing than the plight of Aboriginal people living with disabilities. According to Stats Canada, about 15% of the general population are people with disabilities. We have to double that figure to get a measure of how much more serious the issues are in Aboriginal communities. Thirty-one percent of our community members live with a disability - almost a third of our population are leading lives of quiet desperation. This reality influences the life of the entire community. In Canada, we are a democracy and we are judged not only how we treat everyone but on how we treat the people who need the help the most. The weakest, and the people that are most marginalized.

Nature's Spectrum is one of Canada's original Infrared sauna companies established in 1999 and incorporated in 2001. We opened the first Infrared Sauna user facility in Victoria BC where hundreds of clients have visited to experience the benefits of Infrared saunas. We have seen a lot of sweat here! Nature's Spectrum developed an objective testing procedure to gauge sauna heaters' IR output in our quest to acquire the highest performing Infrared heaters. Our testing procedure has been contracted by other IR sauna companies to validate their heaters' Infrared. In the past 11 years, our company has collaborated with top manufacturers in the industry in North America, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. We have always sought out Infrared sauna products that ensure a satisfying sauna experience, use high quality materials and boast superior craftsmanship. In November 2008, we partnered with Golden Wave Saunas of Taiwan to create the new Sun Stream Sauna. Golden Wave is an established company that has produced IR saunas and IR therapy products for 10 years. They are one of very few sauna companies who develop and produce their own Infrared heaters, the internationally patented Nano-Carbon heaters. We are an authentic sauna company that strives to ensure that you enjoy a satisfying experience with your new sauna. We provide deliveries and installations in BC and ship our saunas across Canada regularly. We stock spare parts for the products we sell and have the expertise to provide proper after sales service. Sun Stream Saunas are backed with an Unconditional Lifetime Manufacturer's Warranty on our Nano-Carbon heaters and Five Years on our Electronic Control Systems. Please Note: Most low cost saunas sold through Big Box retailers have only One Year Warranties from remote secondary distributors. With years of experience working with and using Infrared saunas, we believe our Sun Stream to be the best performing, best constructed and best sauna for your money available.

His practice is focused on representing people who have been injured due to the negligence of others. He handles motor vehicle accidents, occupier’s liability (a.k.a. slip-and-fall), and medical malpractice cases. Mitchell has helped people with a vast array of injuries, including complex brain, orthopedic, psychiatric, vestibular, and chronic pain disorders / soft tissue injuries. He currently sits on the executive council of the Victoria Bar Association and is a member of the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia and the Canadian Bar Association.

“I think it is important to recognize that each person’s individual characteristics can result in one person being affected very differently by an accident than another person, even though they may have suffered similar injuries. I like to get to know my clients so that I can better understand how their injuries have affected them and use that information to achieve a result that is fair in their individual circumstances.”

","The words Love Is Round arrived in Sherry Morgan's prayer time in October, 2015. A flood of inspiration followed, including an understanding of what those words point to and why they are so important and relevant at this time. Love is Round points to a core design of our universe, which we are integrally a part of, and explains the experience people have when connecting with aspects of the natural world. Teaching people about the Phenomenon of Prayer, the core basis of which is the experience of connection with aspects of the natural world, has been Sherry’s work since 1998. Love is Round became the context for her work and the name for her website.

","Rubbish psychology 101. Over time, Mark's hauling and Recycling has learned a thing or two about rubbish. The most striking fact we uncovered was that we love our junk! We accumulate it we hang on to it, we have emotions and memories attached to it. Each item has a story to tell, it's hard to let go. But when the house is full and can't park the car in the garage anymore, the inevitable happens we snap! We want to see it all gone right now. But don't feel guilty. The renewal process has just begun. Mark's hauling and recycling will find a new purpose for all those treasures, and that's no trash.

It means that I deal with any type of claim involving a person suffering injuries through the fault of another. However, I do not deal with Workers' Compensation claims. The most common type of claim is for injuries suffered in a car accident. If the accident occurred in BC then it is likely you are dealing with the ICBC. I have a great deal of experience in dealing with these claims. I also deal with claims for long term disability (LTD) benefits and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits. My clients are located all over British Columbia and elsewhere. My general philosophy is focused upon recovery. What I mean by this is that I do whatever I can to assist clients in recovering from their injuries.

","What do I do? Essentially, I help people. I practice personal injury law. What does that mean? It means that I deal with any type of claim involving a person suffering injuries through the fault of another. However, I do not deal with Workers' Compensation claims. The most common type of claim is for injuries suffered in a car accident. If the accident occurred in BC then it is likely you are dealing with the ICBC. I have a great deal of experience in dealing with these claims. I also deal with claims for long term disability (LTD) benefits and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits. My clients are located all over British Columbia and elsewhere. My general philosophy is focused upon recovery. What I mean by this is that I do whatever I can to assist clients in recovering from their injuries.

","Welcome to R&R Projectz! We specialize in cabinet refacing. What is cabinet refacing? Cabinet refacing consists of removing the old doors and drawers, replacing them with new colour coordinated doors, ranging from wood to thermofoil (PVC). We then use matching materials for the outer surfaces to match your new door choice. (This includes panels, toe-kick, and edge taping).Is refacing right for me?    Do you like your current kitchen layout?    Do your existing kitchen cabinets have that ""worn out"" or ""outdated"" appearance,     but are solidly constructed?    Do you want a fresh look for your kitchen without the cost of a whole new kitchen?     Or the time constraint of a full renovation?    Do you want to add drawers, roll-outs, lazy susans and cabinet modifications     without changing your entire kitchen?If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then kitchen refacing is for you!

The mandate of the BC Aboriginal Network on Disability Society is: To Promote the Betterment of Aboriginal People with Disabilities. The organization was founded in July 1991, to deal specifically with the issues of Aboriginal People with special needs. Quote from the Honourable Ethel Blondin-Andrew, Minister of Secretary of State, Children and Youth (in an address to the BCANDS General Assembly Oct. 1995): There are few situations more challenging or more pressing than the plight of Aboriginal people living with disabilities. According to Stats Canada, about 15% of the general population are people with disabilities. We have to double that figure to get a measure of how much more serious the issues are in Aboriginal communities. Thirty-one percent of our community members live with a disability - almost a third of our population are leading lives of quiet desperation. This reality influences the life of the entire community. In Canada, we are a democracy and we are judged not only how we treat everyone but on how we treat the people who need the help the most. The weakest, and the people that are most marginalized.
